# 0.  From Problem Analysis to Data Definitions

The problem that we are going to solve is that we need to gather some data
from the user of how they want their bingo boards to look. Once we have that information,
we can create the bingo boards and give the user some options for how they want to see them


# 1.  System Analysis

The flow of the program will be as follows
    * Ask the user if they want to create a deck or exit the program
    * Ask the user for some information on creating the board
    * Create the board
    * Use a menu to interact with the user on how they want to view the deck


# 2.  Functional Examples

The program will be asking the user on multiple occasions for user input.
We will need to be checking that the user input is valid so that it works how we 
want it to and doesnt crash


# 3.  Function Template

Begin writing code from the architecture from step 1. If we get stuck or confused review
steps 0 and 1 or possibly edit them until we have a clear understanding of how
we are going to solve the problem



# 4.  Testing

Run the test cases against the code to verify that the outcome of the program
is the outcome that we are expecting. Attempt throwing some edge cases at your
program to guarantee that it is going to work
